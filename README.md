# Utilizing Genetic Algorithms to optimize University Schedules

Project for the course of Computational Intelligence for Optimization

**Instructions**
<br>
To run the code, download all .py files to the same directory and run the 'experiments.py' file. When it finishes running, to generate the plots, run 'utils.py'.
Consider deleting the 'True' option in 'experiments.py' for fitness sharing otherwise the computations take exponentially longer and with no improvement in results.
